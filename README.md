 Attendance is an essential task in the educational institutions to evaluate the class 
presence of a student. Mostly, educational institutions implement paper-based attendance 
system in which teacher records attendance of students on a paper sheet and these paper 
sheets will be kept with teacher till the end of session. It is also time consuming and 
utilizes class lecture time. 
To overcome this problem, we have developed a C programming-based attendance 
management system to save teacher’s time and keep attendance record digitally. We have 
used fundamental programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, switch-case 
statement, arrays, functions to develop a smart attendance management system. This 
project can save teacher’s time and automated calculations will be done. This project is 
just a basic prototype for solving a real-life problem.

The features that are programmed are mentioned below. 
1. Students Name and ID will be already stored in program using arrays. 
2. User will be allowed to mark attendance of the student. 
3. Attendance record of all the students can be viewed at once. 
4. The attendance record of a single student can be viewed. 
5. The eligibility of students will be displayed that even student is allowed to appear in 
exam or not.

Program begins with initializing the arrays to store student names and their respective IDs. 
Then a function which is defined to display a menu on the screen then user will be allowed 
to enter integer for respective option shown in menu. Then program will refer to the switch
case statement and compares the user choice with all cases and call the function according 
to user’s choice. User is allowed to choose a number for 1 to 5 for respective option.  
If user choice is ‘1’ then function will display the students one by one and ask the user to 
mark attendance by entering a character ‘P’ or ‘A’. If users enter ‘P’ then it will be stored 
in array which was declared at start of program.  
If user choice is ‘2’ then a function will be called which will display the attendance record 
of all the students.  
If user choice is ‘3’ then a function will be called which will ask for student id and then 
user enters id and data related to that id will be fetched and displayed complete attendance 
record of a single student.  
If user choice is ‘4’ then a function will be called which will display the student’s name, 
attendance percentage and displays that student is allowed to appear in exam or not. 
If user choice is ‘5’ then program will stop execution and return zero value.
If user choice is ‘4’ then a function will be called which will display the student’s name, 
attendance percentage and displays that student is allowed to appear in exam or not. 
If user choice is ‘5’ then program will stop execution and return zero value.
